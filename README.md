# Smart Login System

Modern login system with guidness.

## Description

It is a login system consists of 3 pages. The sign up page where you enter your full name , email and a password. In addition to guidness messages to make it quick through the validation process.
Speaking of the validation, We validate through java script.

The second page is going to be the login page. We have your back by a warning message box to cover any input errors.

The last page is a welcome page to make sure everything has gone great! With a touch of creativity. We prevent any bad user experience like showing the page while it is loading. And we treated this by a fitting layer covers the page till the load is over.

The user can't access the welcome page nor see any of its content untill he logs in.
Add to this the page will be directed to the login page. Furthermore if you were going to the login page while you are logging in, you would be directed to the welcome page.

To be mentioned, the web site is responsive.
